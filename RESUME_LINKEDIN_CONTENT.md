## INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS

### When Discussing This Project:

**Technical Depth:**
"I built Aegis CLI using a modular architecture with Click framework. Each of the 8 modules is self-contained but shares a unified configuration system. I implemented multi-threading for the port scanner to achieve concurrent execution across hundreds of ports simultaneously."

**Security Knowledge:**
"The tool demonstrates understanding of security fundamentals - from network reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment to log forensics and system hardening. For example, the SSL analyzer checks for deprecated protocols like TLS 1.0/1.1 and weak cipher suites."

**Problem Solving:**
"One challenge was implementing real-time file monitoring. I used MD5 hashing to detect content changes and built an efficient scanning algorithm that tracks file states without excessive resource usage."

**Best Practices:**
"I followed software engineering best practices - modular design for maintainability, comprehensive test coverage with PyTest, Docker containerization for portability, and professional documentation."

**Impact:**
"This tool can perform comprehensive security assessments that would typically require multiple separate tools, reducing assessment time and providing unified reporting for security teams."
